# Prototyping-in-Projects
## What is Prototyping?
Prototyping is a type of development cycle used to create software, at the end of every cycle a version of the desired product is made. This version is then tested and evaluated to pinpoint what parts of the software work and what needs to be fixed. With the evaluation in mind, planning for the next prototype version can begin. This creates an evolutionary cycle that builds upon each previous version of the product, until a version has been created that meets the specifications of the software. 

## Forms of prototyping and the advantages it has for the client and developer and meeting user requirements?
